# nd-convert

## About

This tool converts the natural deduction syntax specified by `tree-sitter-nd` into various different forms. The first that will be supported is LaTeX, but others may eventually be supported.

Fitch style is the only planned style, but this may expand to export to different style types too.


## TODO
- Transition to intermediate form (text -> syntax tree -> common tree -> export)
  - This allows for more generalised conversions.
